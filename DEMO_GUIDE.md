## 🎯 Demo Script for Each Prototype

### 🤖 **Prototype 1: Default Path (Traditional AI)**

**Key Message:** "Minimal user control, AI-driven recommendations"

**Demo Flow (2-3 minutes):**

1. **Show initial recommendation**
   - "Here the AI automatically shows me a recommended activity"
   - Point out: Title, difficulty badge, topic, estimated time

2. **Interact with buttons**
   - Click **Accept** → "When I accept, it logs my decision and shows the next recommendation"
   - Click **Reject** several times → "I can reject, but I have no control over what comes next"

3. **Show history**
   - Scroll to bottom → "The system tracks my decisions but doesn't learn from them"
   - **Limitation:** "This is the baseline - users have minimal agency"

**Key Points to Mention:**
- ✅ Fast and efficient
- ✅ No cognitive load
- ❌ No user control
- ❌ No transparency
- ❌ Can't express preferences

   - **Difficulty Matching** → "Based on my learning history"
   - **Time Planning** → "Fits my typical study duration"
   - **Knowledge Connection** → "How it connects to the curriculum"

3. **Show Confidence Metrics**
   - Point to the confidence bars
   - "Content Match: 92% - The AI is very confident this matches"
   - "Difficulty Fit: 85% - Good challenge level"
   - "Time Suitability: 88% - Reasonable time commitment"

4. **Show Database Statistics**
   - Point to the green statistics box
   - "The AI analyzed 45 activities across 3 topics to make this recommendation"

5. **Toggle Explanation**
   - Click **Hide AI Explanation** button
   - "Users can hide this if they trust the AI"
   - Click **Show AI Explanation** again
   - "Or reveal it when they want to understand the reasoning"

6. **Accept and Track Progress**
   - Click **Accept** button
   - Show the completion counter
   - "The system learns from my patterns and adjusts future recommendations"

**Key Points to Mention:**
- ✅ Builds trust through transparency
- ✅ Educational value (users learn how AI thinks)
- ✅ Empowers informed decisions
- ✅ Sophisticated confidence metrics
- ⚠️ More information to process

## 🎓 Talking Points for Each Prototype

### Research Questions to Address:

1. **User Autonomy vs. Convenience**
   - Default: Maximum convenience, minimum control
   - Co-Creation: Balanced approach
   - Explainable: Informed autonomy

2. **Trust and Transparency**
   - Default: "Trust me, I know best"
   - Co-Creation: "Let's decide together"
   - Explainable: "Here's why I suggest this"

3. **Cognitive Load**
   - Default: Lowest (passive)
   - Co-Creation: Medium (active preferences)
   - Explainable: Higher (understanding reasoning)

4. **User Satisfaction**
   - Which do users prefer?
   - Does transparency increase trust?
   - Is co-creation worth the extra effort?

## 📝 Sample Narration Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Today I'm presenting three different AI interaction patterns for a learning coach system. Each prototype represents a different philosophy in human-AI collaboration."

### For Each Prototype (2-3 min each)
"In [Prototype Name], the key design principle is [principle]. Let me show you how it works..."

[Demo the prototype]

"The advantages are [list]. The trade-offs are [list]."

### Closing (1 minute)
"These three prototypes demonstrate that there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The best design depends on the context, user needs, and the balance between automation and control. My research question is: which approach do users prefer and why?"
